"# Social_Skills" 

This project was created for HackPrinceton Fall 2017. The website I created is intended to help those who struggle with recognizing facial expressions.

Discrete trials in ABA therapy (ABA is the only treatment for autism that insurance covers) often involves flash cards, worksheets, or other methods that often resemble school work.
The goal of this project was to provide another option for therapists who want to engage their clients. My hope is that others may see this and be inspired to create similar interactive methods of learning.

You will need a webcam to try it out and you may need to adjust security settings for your webcam.
